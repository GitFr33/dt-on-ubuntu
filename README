This is a recipe for setting up compile dependencies for DarkTable 3.0
on Ubuntu 1910.

Dependencies
============
    Multipass:
    The scrips requires Ubuntu Multipass to be installed, as all activity
    takes place within a virtual machine. You can of course create your own 
    Ubuntu 19.10 VM and fire off the "compile script" there.

    Multipass is a snap away on Ubuntu 19.10: snap install --classic multipass

    Git close location:
    Darktable is cloned into ~/git/darktable


What the scripts do:
====================
The compile script does the following:
  - clones Darktable 3.0 from Github into the VM
  - adds llvm repoes to the VM's APT sources
  - adds llvm APT key into the VM
  - installs loads of necessary packages in the VM
  - builds and install Darktable in the VM
  - starts Darktable tp print the --version info in the VM

The end result from running "darktable --version", should be this:

this is darktable 3.0.0

compile options:
  bit depth is 64 bit
  normal build
  SSE2 optimized codepath enabled
  OpenMP support enabled
  OpenCL support enabled
  Lua support enabled, API version 5.0.2
  Colord support enabled
  gPhoto2 support enabled
  GraphicsMagick support enabled
  OpenEXR support enabled


How to compile DT30 for Ubuntu 19.10 in a VM
============================================
cd to the 1910 directory
chmod u+x install_in_vm.sh
./install_in_vm.sh


Issues:
=======
 - Documentation is not compiled
 - The "sed" command in the install_in_vm.sh script is not parameterized
 - darktable is installe in ~/darktable, there are some hardcoded references
 


Once you are happy that things work, consider changing the script to your liking
and fire it off the script on your
computer to enjoy the new DT goodness :-)
